# HEATH GARVEY'S CUBIST PARADISE

## NAME:
Heath Garvey

## TIME TAKEN
~20 minutes

## FAVOURITE FEATURES
While exploring interactive components and the Unity asset store were the most enjoyable features of this project, deploying to smartphone was certainly the most rewarding. Being able to immerse yourself in something you've created only moments earlier is unreal.

## GREATEST CHALLENGE
No particular difficulties on this one, aside from the inability to upload the original experience I'd spent an hour on :( I'd cleaned the parent directory however the public domain environment asset I'd used supposedly contained over 1,000 files and didn't meet Udacity's upload criteria.

 That aside, I'm looking forward to fleshing out some C# skills in coming projects :)
