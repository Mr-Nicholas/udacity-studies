# Heath's Maze

## NAME
Heath Garvey

## INSTRUCTIONS
Install the .apk file onto your Android device and take the app for a spin!

## TIME TAKEN
Many, many hours. I was definitely over ambitious with the scale of this project.

## FAVOURITE FEATURES
Holistically, the novel approach to a typical maze.

## GREATEST CHALLENGE
Where to start...

While understanding the logic is simple enough, the scripting was deceptively difficult.

## KNOWN ISSUES
- The coinCounter UI only seems to update when one specific Coin instance is clicked. I'd love some help on this one.

- The placement of the coinCounter UI is an issue at the moment too. I'm not sure of the best position to continually display this without being a distraction to the user. I'm assuming we look at this in the VR Design component for this course.

- I've had to hardcode the 'holdsKey' and 'locked' variables on the SignPost script, is there a way to reset the scene with an inbuilt function that automatically resets the variables to their initial state?

- When a User enters the 'MazeComplete' scene without a key, they can use the waypoint behind them to return to the maze scene. Rather than have the user return to the start of the scene, what's the best approach to setting the camera position to the outside of the temple?
