# UDACITY VR NANODEGREE
Here lies the build files for my virtual reality nanodegree. All projects have been built and optimised for the Google Cardboard HMD (head mounted display) to be run on Android.

## Course Components
- [x] Unit One: A basic VR interface with user interaction
- [x] Unit Two: A basic VR apartment experience designed
- [x] Unit Three: A VR maze designed and scripted
- [x] Unit Four: A VR puzzle game built using iterative testing and VR UX principles
- [x] Unit Five: An immersive language learning experience [CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS]
- [ ] Unit Six:

## Built With
All projects were built using Unity 3D, with C# programming written in MonoDevelop.

## Installation Instructions
Detailed installation instructions are provided within each folder.

Note: the Plugins folder with the iOS and Android directories have been removed to save online storage. In order to build each scene within Unity to device, this file will need to be added to the Assets/Plugins directory.

## Specifications
- Each .apk build requires an Android OS.
- While the projects can be viewed without a HMD, use of the Google Cardboard is strongly recommended.

## Known Issues
There are currently no known bugs in the Unity scenes. If you happen to find one, just pretend like you never saw it and we can still be friends.
