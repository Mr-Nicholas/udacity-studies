# "Mars Escape" - A VR Puzzler

Mars Escape is a concise mobile VR game built for the Google Cardboard. An assessable component of the Udacity VR Nanodegree, this project has users begin in a gritty dungeon setting within which they are required to decipher a puzzle involving floating orbs. Upon successful completion they escape the dungeon and what would otherwise be a grisly fate.

## NAME
Aside from the desire to evoke user nightmares via the scene’s macabre atmosphere, the underlying intention in creating this piece was to adopt a user-centric approach to VR design and development in producing VR content. In identifying user considerations unique to the medium, the intention was to create a game that drew on the growing pool of UX knowledge surrounding spatial sound, audio and visual cues, movement and intuitive menu systems.

## PROJECT
With this project tested on volunteers without previous VR experience, simulation sickness and the intuitiveness of menus were fundamental concerns in both the development and testing phases. This project was therefore a great primer on the necessity for iterative development when producing VR content.

## NEXT STEPS
Keen to execute ‘A Puzzling Liaison’ (see sketches), it’s my ambition to extract the scripting and business logic of Mars Escape and applying it to a far more humorous, contemporary bedroom environment.
