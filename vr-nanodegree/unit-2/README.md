## NAME
Heath Garvey

## TIME TAKEN
Several hours over the course of three weeks.

## FAVOURITE FEATURES
Modeling the scene off Jake & Finn's treehouse made the aesthetic decisions easier and more enjoyable.

## GREATEST CHALLENGE
Plenty of challenges in this one.

On a macro level, sporadically spending time creating the scene rather than completing it in a single week meant that a number of the basic techniques acquired throughout the lessons were forgotten and required revisiting. In addition, I had lofty goals for both scene appearance and interaction but had to come to terms with the need to rein them in until technical competency can sustain personal vision.

On a micro level:
- I found animating the globe reasonably difficult to understand.
- Figuring out how to snap GameObjects to others.
- Creating the correct lighting settings optimised for mobile.
- Building a lightmap (that didn't make the lighting appear overexposed).
- Working with teleporters. In an earlier attempt I tried configuring these but soon abandoned the idea due to growing complexity.
